## Structure

- **Main Files**:
  - `risk_analytics.py`: The primary script for risk analytics.
  - `run.bat`: A batch script to facilitate easy execution.
  - `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required.

- **Configuration**:
  - `config/`: Contains multiple `.ini` files to dictate how the main script runs under different scenarios or settings.

- **Data**:
  - `data/`: Input data files, categorized further into `instrument/` and `market/`.

- **Libraries**:
  - `lib/`: Contains helper modules such as `database`, `portfolio`, `risk_engine`, and more.

- **Output**:
  - `output/`: Contains results or reports generated by the main script.

## Setup

1. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**: It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid potential conflicts with other Python projects. You can set up a virtual environment using `venv`:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv_name
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .\venv_name\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv_name/bin/activate
     ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Adjust the configuration `.ini` files in the `config/` directory as needed.

4. Execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python risk_analytics.py --config <path_to_config_file>
   ```

   or simply run:

   ```bash
   run.bat
   ```

## Features

- **Database Integration**: Supports SQLite with provision to switch to SQL Express.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Allows for dynamic risk metric calculations, scenario generations, bond pricing models, and more.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates various reports including portfolio daily yield, cashflow reports, scenario loss PnL vectors, and risk summaries.

## Dependencies

- configparser
- numpy
- openpyxl
- pandas
